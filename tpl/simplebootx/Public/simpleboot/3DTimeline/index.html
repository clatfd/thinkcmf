									<p>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Escape is not his plan. I must face him. Alone.</p>
