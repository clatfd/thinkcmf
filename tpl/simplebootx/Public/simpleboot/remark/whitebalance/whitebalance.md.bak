- According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the tongue can reflect the condition of organs as well as the degree and progression of disease.

- The prevalence and capability of mobile phones offer an ideal platform for our tongue diagnosis system to be practiced.

- In traditional method of tongue diagnosis, doctors determine the syndrome mainly through **visual observation** and **subjective experience**.

- Quite a few computerized tongue diagnosis methods are quite **sensitive** to the quality of the initial tongue image. Camera bears the possibility of **distorting** the original colors of the images

##An Android APP:

- Use QCGP to solve the problem of white balance

- Adapted HSV model in Tongue brim pixels searching

- Adapted inverted pentagonal four-line tongue outline searching and linking algorithm

- Accuracy and effectiveness corroborated with professional clinicians

- Grey World Method:
	K =（R<SUB>avg</SUB>+G<SUB>avg</SUB>+B<SUB>avg</SUB>)/3, R<SUB>new</SUB> = (R*K)/R<SUB>avg</SUB>
	assuming a certain standard spatial spectral average exists

- Perfect Reflector Method:
	R<SUB>new</SUB> = R*255/R<SUB>AvgTop10%</SUB>

- Quadratic combining two balance algorithms: 
	u<SUP>r</SUP>R<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>avg</SUB>+v<SUP>r</SUP>R<SUB>avg</SUB> = K<SUB>avg</SUB>
	u<SUP>r</SUP>R<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>max</SUB>+v<SUP>r</SUP>R<SUB>max</SUB> = K<SUB>max</SUB>

##Parameters:

- thickness of tongue coating: the ratio of the number of tongue coating pixels(a hue range near yellow) to that of total pixels

- average hue of tongue blade pixels: average hue within a hue range near red and also not excessively big in value

- humidity of the tongue: the ratio of pixels with excessively big values to that of total pixels 

- crackle flaws: the ratio of edges pixels in edge image to that of total pixels
